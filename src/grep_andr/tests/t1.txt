When an official of a government or business is acting dishonestly, we say that this person is corrupt. 
Corruption is a serious problem in many countries around the world. There are several different kinds
of corrupt practices, including bribes, kickbacks, nepotism, and embezzlement.

A bribe is a payment of money or some other benefit, in exchange for a decision that would not otherwise
be made. For example, an accused criminal might bribe a judge so that the judge would make a decision of 
“not guilty.” Another example is that a business owner might bribe a government official so that the 
official would allow the construction of very unsafe buildings.

A kickback is similar to a bribe, except that the official receives some part of the money in a 
dishonest business deal. For example, governments sometimes decide which company should build a road.
A company might offer money to the government official who makes the decision, so that this company will 
be chosen, even if it is not the best company for the job.
