Britain is an island. We are surrounded by sea. Nowdays, you can get here by plane, or by train through 
the Channel Tunnel. But before planes were invented, and the Channel Tunnel was built, the only way to come
to Britain was by sea.

The seas around Britain can be very dangerous. The Romans, who conquered England in 43 AD, knew this.
They built lighthouses at Dover in England and Boulogne in France to guide ships across the Channel. 
However, the lighthouses fell into disuse after the Romans left at the beginning of the 5th century. 
For hundreds of years, the seas around Britain were completely dark at night. There was nothing to help 
sailors find their way, or to warn them of dangers.

Among the most dangerous rocks around our coast are the Eddystone Rocks. They lie about 14 
kilometers from the shore of south-west England, in other words at exactly the place where ships crossing 
the Atlantic reach England. Over the centuries, hundreds of ships have been wrecked on the Eddystone Rocks 
and thousands of sailors have lost their lives.

Now let us meet a man called Henry Winstanley. He was born in 1644, and as a young man he became interested 
in architecture and engineering. Later he became a merchant, and bought five ships. Within a few years, two 
of the ships had been wrecked on the Eddystone Rocks. He asked the government why nothing was done to protect
ships from the rocks. The government said that the rocks were far too dangerous and too far from land to 
build a lighthouse there. “Nonsense,” replied Henry Winstanley. “I will build a lighthouse there myself”.

And he did. He started work in 1696. However, England and France were at war, and the following year a 
French ship arrived at the rocks and took Winstanley and his men back to France as prisoners. The French 
King, Louis XIV, ordered that they should be released immediately. “I am at war with England, not with 
humanity”, he said.
